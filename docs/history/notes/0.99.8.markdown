- added support for select.timeout construct.
- added support for lifting-up await in hight-order functions.
 ie in simplicified explanation:
     for(x <- 1 to n) { s += read(x) }
 is translated to `(1 to n).foreachAsync { async(s += await(aread(x))) }`
   Details can be found in techreport: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00602](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00602)

- added support for select.fold construct.
- scala 2.12
