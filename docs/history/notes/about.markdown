  [scala-gopher](https://github.com/rssh/scala-gopher) is a fully asynchronics implementation of CSP (Communication Sequence Process) 
  primitives, built on top of Akka and SIP-22 async.  It provide 'Go-like' channels and behaviour modules 'transputers' 
  (resembling 'Occam-like' pocesses with set of ports) for scala.
